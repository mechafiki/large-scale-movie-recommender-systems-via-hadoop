Among the tested algorithms, matrix factorization and linear models (ALS-WR and regularized user and item effects model) showed good results in terms of RMSE. This indicates a high predictive capability for ratings. However, in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score, these two algorithms obtained acceptable values, but they were also lower compared to other algorithms. In terms of training time and memory management, the results suggest that matrix factorization and linear model can be faster to train and more efficient in terms of system resource management.

Regarding the decision tree algorithm, we observe that in the MovieLens 100k dataset, decision trees displayed high scores for RMSE, precision, recall, and F1 score. This suggests that decision trees are capable of generating high-quality recommendations and efficiently retrieving relevant items. However, this algorithm encountered difficulties in handling larger datasets, resulting in degraded performance. In terms of time, decision trees are relatively fast compared to memory-based algorithms but slower than matrix factorization.

Moving on to the hybridization of decision trees with ALS-WR, in terms of results, this method shows promise. It achieves high scores for RMSE, precision, recall, and F1 score, suggesting a significant improvement compared to using ALS-WR alone. Regarding execution time, the hybridization led to an increase in the training time compared to ALS-WR or decision trees alone.

When comparing the performance of other algorithms, it can be observed that these algorithms exhibit significant memory management demands, especially for large datasets (MovieLens 10M). This increased memory requirement can be considered a constraint in terms of system resource management. These algorithms require storing interaction matrices, similarity matrices, or weighting coefficients to perform recommendation calculations. This can result in a significant increase in memory consumption, especially as the dataset size increases.

AutoRec achieves reasonable performance in both the 100k and 1M datasets, with relatively good RMSE values, and AutoRec based on item performs slightly better than user-based AutoRec. Overall, AutoRec shows high precision, decent recall, and competitive F1 scores compared to other algorithms.

Analyzing the results of similarity-based collaborative filtering, it shows higher RMSE values compared to other algorithms in the study. However, the precision, recall, and F1 scores are competitive with other algorithms. Specifically, Pearson correlation-based collaborative filtering yields the best results. It is important to note that this approach does not have a proper learning phase, but it involves data transformation to prepare it for predictions.

Moving to collaborative filtering with KMeans clustering, the results reveal the highest RMSE values compared to other algorithms, especially for the user-based approach. However, in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score, it achieves competitive results compared to other approaches. Specifically, FCI-KM with cosine distance achieves the best recall values for the 100k and 1M datasets.
